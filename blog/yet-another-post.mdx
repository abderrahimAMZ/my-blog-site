Wow look at all this content. How do they do it?

Here's an example of my new custom code blocks:



Wow! Such code snippets!
Let's see another, with line highlighting:



```rust highlights=3-5
// fizzbuzz in JS
struct Soemthing(i32,i32,i32);

struct Node {
    val : i32,
    next : Box<Node>
}


fn main() -> Option<i32> {
    let val = 9;
    let node = Node::new(val);
    return Some(node.val)
}
```


```rust file=idk.rust highlights=1-2
fn main() -> Option<i32> {
    None
}
```

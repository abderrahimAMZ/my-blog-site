# Introduction

Rust is a modern, systems-level programming language that prioritizes safety, performance, and concurrency. Its design aims to eliminate common programming errors while providing low-level control over system resources. Let's explore some key features that make Rust a compelling choice for developers.

## Safety and Memory Management

One of Rust's standout features is its ownership system, which eliminates many common memory-related bugs, such as null pointer dereferencing and data races. The borrow checker ensures memory safety without the need for a garbage collector. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("Hello, Rust!");

    let len = calculate_length(&s);

    println!("Length of '{}' is {}.", s, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

```rust highlights=3-5
// fizzbuzz in JS
struct Soemthing(i32,i32,i32);

struct Node {
    val : i32,
    next : Box<Node>
}


fn main() -> Option<i32> {
    let val = 9;
    let node = Node::new(val);
    return Some(node.val)
}
```


```rust file=idk.rust highlights=1-2
fn main() -> Option<i32> {
    None
}
```

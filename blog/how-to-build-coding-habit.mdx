# Introduction

![A man coding]("../images/how-to-build-coding-habit-image-1")

build the coding habit is challenging but it's nor really if you know the underlaying of building habits!

## How Building habits is Done

there is a saying by Prophet Mohammed peace upon him :
what in the meaning, "a little that is continous better then a lot disontinous".
so, you should practice a litle by little. go from 5 minutes a day to 10 to 15 to 20 to more!

there is one important rule. when life happens, do the bare minimum.

## programming language matter

Sometimes when the programming language you are trying to use may hold you down. especially, when it's hard.
so, choose a programming langauge that you can enjoy working with. no matter what language it might be and stick to it.

## why you should stick one programming language?

because it's easier to track your progress.also, jumping between languages when you don't have a strong reason is a waste of time. since you could use that time to improve in the langauge you are already good at!

# Introduction

![A man coding]("../images/how-to-build-coding-habit-image-1")

the programming language choice matters and matters a lot!
because that choice ether makes you go up or hold you doing!
it's rather because of the nature of the work you are interested in doing then the programming langauge itself. let me explain more.

## programming langauges are tools

what i mean by programming langauges are tools is that they come to solve certain problems!
not exactly to be a perfect language. "programming languages aren't religions"
what this means is that. the one should look for the problem first.then, look for the programming langauge (tool) that solves your prolem.

## how i  see it
if you are interested in analytics, data science, machine learning or Ai. automation and scripting. learn python.
if you are interested in web development. learn javascript! no competition.
so, what i want to say is the following. look for what drives you which is the problem you want to solve. then , go fo the tools that solves the problem. that simple.

```rust

fn main()-> {
    println!("rust is a good programming language);
}

```
